# dash.vim

This Vim plugin will search for terms using the excellent [Dash][Dash]
app, making API lookups simple.

It provides a new :Dash family of commands and (recommended) mappings.

## Commands, Mappings and Configuration

Read the [help][vim-doc] to know more.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim][pathogen], and then simply copy and paste:

```bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/zehrizzatti/dash.vim.git
```
